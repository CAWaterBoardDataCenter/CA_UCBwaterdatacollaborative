The Water Board Data Collaborative with UCB is currently being housed here: https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery. 

Meredith Lee, Anthony Suen and Laurel Larsen are our partners at UCB and the West Big Data Innovation Hub and Rafa and I are the points on the WB side.

This Spring we are trying out two projects in this partnership – (1) a data-driven hydrology course being taught by Laurel Larsen at UCB and (2) a data science special project series with undergrad and grad students in the newly forming School of Information and Data Sciences. 

For the hydrology course we have already reached out to a hydrology field and data expert, Val Zimmer.  The project entails us joining the class on two lecture periods an one field period – lecture, field, lecture – with the hope that we can learn about the how the hydrologic data life cycle (collect, store, use) informs real world problems (how we use regulate instream flows, water budgets, etc.).  We already went to the first overview lecture, the field day is coming up (if anyone is interested in going let me know), and the final lecture, where Rafa will work with the students to show how data can integrated and used, is in April. We plan to repeat this cycle next year if it seems like the effort on both sides is worth it.

The PWSID to sources project (https://github.com/ggearheart/PWStoSources) will help us map a path forward to one day be able to link a geospatial (in an PWS boundary) point in time to where a person living in that place gets their water from. The github site for that is being built and there are some good examples of how to do this already.  Again we have 4 to 6 students already signed up to help on this and we should make good progress on the actual data problem this semester.
